# Why?

I intent this to be a fun side project while I was busy ~~suffering~~ enjoying in college. I have always been fascinated with games and game development in general, and I have made a few small games myself. One part that I have not explored yet is the labor expensive task that is making a game engine from scratch. *"If they can do it, so can I."*

This is why I started this project and uploading it to GitHub publicly. If you are a game engine nerd and wants to contribute, please do so. I am open to any suggestions and improvements. For more information, please check the [Contributing](#contributing) section.
